The "Inventory Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning in Python" project focuses on predicting future product demand based on historical sales data to optimize inventory management. By collecting and preprocessing data, such as product sales, time-based features, and promotional effects, the project applies machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to forecast demand. Model evaluation is done using metrics like MAE or RMSE, with hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy. The project also incorporates data visualization techniques to display demand trends and forecast results. The goal is to assist businesses in reducing stockouts, overstocking, and improving decision-making for inventory replenishment.
